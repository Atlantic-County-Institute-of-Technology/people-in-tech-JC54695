            James Gosling after graduating college and receiving multiple degrees, started to develop major things. 
            His biggest project was Sun Java and it was the first concept of a Java virtual machine.
            With some people helping him he initiated the Java language project. 
            After many years of work he finally completed it and Java was born. 
            It is the most used programming language of today, with it being used all over the world.
